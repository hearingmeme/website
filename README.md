Grandpa has finally finished v2 of the website. 
Let's spread the word: https://hearingthings.fun

Expect bugs, glitches and 90s-style design choices – it's still a wip!  Glitches? Job isn't finished yet and there's a lot more to come.

A big thank you to @bonk_fun, @RaydiumProtocol and 
@worldlibertyfi
 for their support.  Hearing Things has been in development for three months straight, and we're nowhere near stopping.  

No rug pull. No fade. It's all about degen audio autism forever!
